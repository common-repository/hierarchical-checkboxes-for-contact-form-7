== Description ==

After looking around for a hierarchical selection field in Contact Form 7 with no luck, we have decided to create our own plugin to help out other developers with a similar problem.
This plugin allows a hierarchical list of check boxes, controlled via the WordPress menus, to be placed into a Contact Form 7 form.
